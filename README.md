# Bank statement visualiser

This project is a simple program used for people to run against their bank statements(in the form of a CSV.file). It will visually represent a pie graph breaking down the expense in respective categories

## Reason for creation

+ I wanted to make something that would hep track my expense as I was losing track of my spending


#### Setting Up?
1. Python needs to be installed
  + ` https://www.python.org/downloads/`

2. import matplotlib on pc.
  + `python -m pip install -U pip`
  + `python -m pip install -U matplotlib`

3.  export your bank statement as a CSV file with your respected bank.
  + `change the open file to the name of your CSV file that you are running`
  + `the columns might be different so you might have to keep that in mind and make adjustment prior to running`

#### Going forward with Improvement

1. I would like to make changes to the way the transaction description find a category. Looking for a API or a way that I can use google to look up stores to correctly categories the transaction

2. Ill be making changes to the way the pie graph shows the data and any transaction not in a category. Ill be listing them for the user to decide the best allocation.

3. any recommendation for the way i can improve the algorithm would be apricated.

#### Prepare to deploy your project.
